# Librar.io

## Description

Librar.io is an app that allows users to search for books to read through dynamic specifications. Users could take a quiz to help them narrow down a search if they don't know where to start, or can enter specific criteria and find a book. Users can then track their progress on the book and keep a reading journal. Users can keep a list of books they want to read, and look through old book journals. Users can also find links to where to buy the books their search queries return.

## Installation

Clone our repository to check out the code, or visit the live site above to see it deployed.

## Usage

Try out the different search methods, or add a book you'r ecurrently reading to the journal section.
